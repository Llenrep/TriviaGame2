# TriviaGame
creating a trivia game!

The point of this game is to use jquery and javascript to create responsive questions that users can
actually intereact with

The difference between this and the last assignment is that we are now utilizing the timer function.

For this trivia game, the user will have 10 seconds to answer 8 questions.

At the end of the game, the user will be prompted with the questions that were correct and the
questions that were wrong.

The way I am trying to do it, every 10 seconds, the div will change having the same structure, but different
questions.
